Chest Doesn T Feel Sore After Workout Workout Printable Planner From workout-printable-planner.blogspot.com
I have learned that once you have utilized all different training methods in your attempt to “shock your muscles”, that your body just adapts and no longer becomes sore. Not feeling sore after workouts can also be because you’ve started consuming the right kinds of food and the adequate hours of rest and sleep. The inflammation makes them sensitive and an aggressive approach to stretching won’t make them recover any faster. The type of exercise that causes the most muscle soreness is “eccentric” exercise, which is where force is generated by the muscle as it lengthens — think about walking downhill or the lowering phase of a bicep curl.
