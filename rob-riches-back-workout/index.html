MY TYPICAL LEG WORKOUT Rob Riches — Fitness Model, Competitor, Author From robriches.com
Performing kettlebell swings will improve your stability and work a variety of muscle groups while engaging your hips, glutes, and hamstrings. Use a bench to create a right angle for your knees. Rob will eat around 2,700 calories each day to maintain his physique (40% protein, 35% carbs, and 25% fats). I am back at the gym, sharing my back workout, focused on conditioning the muscles and improving strength and size.
