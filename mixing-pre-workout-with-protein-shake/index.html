If you’re using a blender, simply add all of your ingredients (protein powder on top of the liquid!) and blend until smooth. 1 cup of greek yogurt. Optimum nutrition amino energy rtd.

These results suggest that as long as you consume protein around your workout, it doesn�t matter if it�s before or after training. Following resistance exercise, the rates of both protein synthesis and breakdown are often elevated.[1,2] in other words, you are both stimulating the growth of new muscle, and withdrawing amino acids from existing tissue.without an increase in amino acids in the blood to fuel the synthesis process, protein breakdown will remain elevated.</p>
