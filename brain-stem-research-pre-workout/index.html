<p>The brain stem (especially the pons and medulla) also plays a special. The databases pubmed, web of science, and embase were searched for articles investigating regional brain adaptations to exercise. Moreover, an active lifestyle might prevent or delay loss of cognitive function with aging or neurodegenerative disease.
