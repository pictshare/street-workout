<p>Is a full body workout two or three times a week as effective as a split routine working out 5 or 6 days a week? Yes full body training covers the lean and functional muscle mass production and helps with fat loss. I definitely agree, two days a week is more than enough, because your muscles grow while resting not in the gym, i workout twice a week also, sometimes once a week, but i redeem myself if i only workout once by hitting the weights intensely hard. Bench press, standing db press, rear delts, abs.</p>

<p>My recomendation for a sample routine would be something like: Undulating periodization allows you to manage your workout intensity effectively so you can train for both hypertrophy and strength within the same workout block. This is because you’ll be stimulating your muscles in one session, and to do this daily will not give them enough time to recover. Don�t find enough time to workout?

<p>(picture courtesy of alexander leonidas on youtube) firstly, the answers here seem to rely heavily on the premise that training 2 times a week means training each muscle group once a week.
