PreWorkout 101 Is PreWorkout Bad for You? SuppScholar From suppscholar.com
Anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes of exercise per day is probably an ideal sweet spot. I will only hit up the gym twice a day a couple times a week. If you’re exercising later in the day and you’ve eaten a meal within the last two to three hours, you should be fine to do your workout without any. With proper diet, rest and supplementation it is possible to get enough recovery so that you can train each muscle twice per week.
