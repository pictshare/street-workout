Synchronised swimming (in american english, synchronized swimming) or artistic swimming is a sport where swimmers perform a synchronized choreographed routine, accompanied by music. Hours in the pool practicing the sport can bring an enviable level of physical fitness. Some of the most iconic images of synchronized swimming involve long legs with pointed toes sticking up in the air, forming some sort of design. Plyometric exercises feature heavily in any synchronized swimming workout, helping swimmers to develop explosive strength without building bulky muscles.
