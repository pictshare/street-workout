<p>A weighted vest can replace a dip belt, but a dip belt cannot. Thatï¿½s the reason dip belts are often used in weighted bodyweight fitness competitions. The weighted belt cinches around the waist to provide a comfortable and easy way to add weight to your workouts, and you can use it for both resistance training and contrast training. If either of these applies to you, perhaps a waist weight belt for walking and exercise can address your needs.</p>
