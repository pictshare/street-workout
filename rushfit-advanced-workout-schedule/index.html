Rushfit intermediate Training Calendar Weeks 18 From pdfslide.net
Rushfit is less expensive in terms of program price and equipment price than both p90x and insanity. For me i chose intermediate because advanced has you doing 2 workouts a day in some cases which was more than an international blogging superstar such as myself could fit in. After two days of comparing different fitness programs and reading reviews, i have decided to change things up and commit to the gsp rushfit workout program as seen here. While owings guides the workouts, gsp isn’t.
