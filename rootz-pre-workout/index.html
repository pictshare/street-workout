<p>The tub of protein yields 20 servings of 14 grams of protein. Check out our full review: I wanted something that was made from real, whole foods, didn�t contain any nasty chemicals or sweeteners, but was also highly effective and didn�t taste earthy. Finding a protein powder for my sporty husband that didn’t taste “fake” and that was only made with real ingredients has been quite a struggle… and for this reason, when rootz pre work out energizer and rootz post workout paleo protein superfoods entered in our kitchen, they immediately became winners!!.</p>
