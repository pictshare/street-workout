YoYo Flywheel Basic Lower Body Resistance Exercises YouTube From youtube.com
Add in a few exercises at the end of a conventional program as a finishing option. A lot of home exercise bikes try to increase the weight of the flywheel. In flywheel or isoinertial training, choosing inertia means more than deciding between light and heavy. The heavier the flywheel, the harder it’s going to be to pedal and thus the greater the resistance will be.

<p>The flywheels on exercise bikes usually work in pairs with some kind of resistance technique. During a flywheel workout, you experience that the energy you put into the concentric phase (pull) equals the energy that you need to put into the eccentric phase (deceleration), to slow the flywheel down.
